        <h3>Knowing Your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation</h3>

        <ul class="points">
            <li>Style repeatedly drifts in and out of high and low culture like an undertow</li>
            <li>When design and context are inextricably linked, it is good. When design detaches from its context, we are left with cliches, embarrassments…deaths.</li>
            <li><strong>Reminder for designers and design students today:</strong> if you borrow from a certain style, it’s important to know where that style came from, as well as the social and cultural contexts that gave that style its rise. </li>
            <li>We all know that style goes from high to low and high again, but identifying a style’s context breeds visual literacy and shepherds innovation.</li>
            <li>2009 Want It campaign for Saks designed by Shepard Fairey’s Studio Number One</li>
            <img class="img" src="./Images/Saks.jpg">
            <li>This uncanny impersonation of Constructivism recycles more than just a visual language</li>
            <li>In the late 1910s and early 1920s, Constructivism grew out of a Soviet State sponsored movement designed to disseminate political doctrine. Collectivism, universality, practicality, industry, and purity evoked the new Soviet utopia, yielding a simplified red, black, and white Communist palette.</li>
            <img class="img" src="./Images/Construct.webp">
            <li>Constructivism featured intoxicating thick red and black stripes, primary shapes, and images that comprised a universal language engaging an illiterate peasant population. </li>
            <li>Type was meant to be seen and heard. The dynamically composed forms conjure a vision of the new world, “constructed” through a new visual architecture. </li>
            <li>This style tip-toed around subsequent cliche, embarrassment, death, etc. yet over the decades, the style was still fetishized and revived. </li>
            <li>Studio Number One’s advertising campaign for the luxury department store copied it verbatim. English language messages were written in geometric, Cyrillic-inspired letterforms to connote Russian typography. The campaign’s black and white photography mimics that of Alexander Rodchenko’s photos of spirited Communist youths gazing toward an idealized future. </li>
            <img class="img" src="./Images/Want it.jpg">
            <li>At first glance, seeing a high-end retailer like Saks appropriate the Constructivist methodology to sell high fashion to their beau monde clientele was a complete assault on the original Soviet mission—it felt completely out of context. </li>
            <li>Yet upon closer examination, Want It theoretically stoked the 2008 recession-era economy.</li>
            <li>Studio Number One hijacked the Constructivist ethos to fire up a patriotic faith through unmitigated stylistic quotation.</li>
            <li>Despite the nearly hundred years separating the Constructivist and Studio Number One campaigns, a repeat performance of art and politics converge, the context presented itself once again. </li>
            <li>it has been done, and it will be done again.</li>
            <li>Knowing your history nourishes originality and edifies creative disruption—a prerequisite for our contemporary postmodern, hyper-exposed and hyper-accessed context.</li>

        </ul>
